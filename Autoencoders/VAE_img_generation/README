Exploring Variational Autoencoders with Tiny Car Images: A Hands-On Experiment
Have you ever wondered how machines can generate new images after learning from just a few examples? I recently explored this by building a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) — a type of neural network designed to learn the essence of images, and even generate new ones.

What’s a Variational Autoencoder?
A VAE is a special kind of autoencoder used in unsupervised learning. While a standard autoencoder compresses and reconstructs data, a VAE goes further:
It learns not just how to reconstruct, but how to model a distribution of the input data in a compressed latent space.
Once trained, you can sample from this latent space to generate new images that resemble the training set.
In short, a VAE learns to imagine!

My Experiment
For this project, I used very small grayscale images of cars — just 30×60 pixels each. Here’s what I did:
Built a VAE in PyTorch, parameterized to support grayscale or RGB images at any resolution.
Trained the model on a small custom dataset of car images.
Sampled from the latent space to generate new images that resemble cars — images the model had never seen before.
Despite the simplicity and limited dataset, the VAE was able to reconstruct patterns and generate new blurry, but interesting, shapes that looked somewhat like cars.
What I Learned
VAEs are powerful tools for understanding and generating data distributions.
Even a small dataset can produce meaningful results with the right approach.
The output was far from perfect — but seeing a neural network generate something from random noise is truly rewarding.
Next Steps
I plan to:
Use higher-resolution images and a larger dataset.
Experiment with RGB color channels.
Possibly explore conditional VAEs to generate specific types of vehicles.
Use a more powerful support for my experiments.
