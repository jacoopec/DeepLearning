Steps:
-Generate 3D synthetic data with some correlation.
-PCA finds the directions of maximum variance in the data and projects the data onto a 2D plane defined by those directions (principal components).
-This visualization clearly shows how PCA identifies key directions in the data and projects onto them. 

The first principal component (PC1) is the direction of maximum variance.

The second principal component (PC2) is orthogonal to PC1 and captures the next highest variance, and so on.
