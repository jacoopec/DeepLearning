Feature	Description
hidden_size=64	More capacity to learn patterns
num_layers=2	A stacked LSTM captures more complex sequences
Dropout(0.2)	Prevents overfitting
fc1 â†’ fc2	Deeper fully connected layer adds learning power


LSTM models learn patterns over time, so you must format your data as sliding windows of time steps.
