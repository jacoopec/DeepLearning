What You Need for a GAN in PyTorch

A GAN consists of two neural networks:

Generator (G) – Learns to create fake data (e.g., fake images)
Discriminator (D) – Learns to distinguish real from fake data

They’re trained in an adversarial loop:
G tries to fool D <---> D tries to catch G


Example projects:
Project Idea	                      Description
MNIST GAN	                    Generate handwritten digits
Fashion-MNIST GAN	            Generate fake clothing images
DCGAN on CIFAR-10	            Use convolutional GANs for color images
Anomaly Detection with GANs   	Learn to detect data that G can’t reproduce
