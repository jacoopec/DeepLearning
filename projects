Image Classifier: Classify cats vs. dogs, or recognize handwritten digits (MNIST).
Audio Classifier: Classify different sounds (dog bark, siren, clapping).
Voice Cloning / Synthesis: Use Tacotron 2 + WaveGlow or VITS for voice generation.

Question Answering Bot: Train a BERT-based model on a Q&A dataset like SQuAD.
Text Summarizer: Generate summaries of articles using encoder-decoder architecture (e.g., T5).


üïπÔ∏è Reinforcement Learning Projects
üîπ Beginner
CartPole Balancer: Classic OpenAI Gym task using DQN or PPO.

Project Ideas for Classification
1. Image Classification ‚Äî CIFAR-10
Dataset: 60,000 color images in 10 classes (airplane, cat, truck, etc.)

Why it's great: Small enough to train quickly, popular for learning.

PyTorch-ready: Available in torchvision.datasets

2. Tabular Data Classification ‚Äî Titanic Survival
Dataset: Titanic passenger info (age, class, fare) ‚Üí predict survival

Why it's great: Great for learning feature preprocessing + model structure.

PyTorch aspect: You learn how to build datasets and dataloaders manually.

3. Time-Series Classification ‚Äî Human Activity Recognition
Dataset: Smartphone sensor data ‚Üí predict activity (walking, sitting, etc.)
Why it's great: Shows how to handle sequence/time-based inputs.
PyTorch challenge: Learn how to work with LSTM or 1D CNNs.
